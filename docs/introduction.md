# Welcome

This website is intended to kickstart your ROS journey by providing the most relevant information to get started on a project. You will learn about the Publisher and Subscriber architecture, how to interact with the Linux system, as well as Python tutorials to allow you to begin writing code as soon as possible. 

## What to look for

First off, ROS is typically used in conjunction with Linux, and Python (or c++) so understanding these tools first will make your first time creating an ROS project much smoother. ROS is just a set of tools that you download, and typically the operating system of choice for ROS users is Linux. 

Understanding the fundamentals of Linux, as well as the tricks to navigate through the terminal is key to working with ROS. 

Python is one of two choices to use when you are actually programming your robot. Python is the obvious chice for beginner programmers as its syntax is quite simple to pick up. There are a few things however, that are good to pick up before you start ROS, which we will get into in the upcoming tutorials. 

After you learn the basics of Linux and Python, then you are ready to tackel ROS and its amazing features. Good luck and thanks for reading!
